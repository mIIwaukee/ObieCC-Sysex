# Control Oberheim Matrix 6, 6R, 100 with CC

I wanted to use my Arduino to remap Midi CC commands to Sysex for the Oberheim Matrix 6.
I used a control surface, the Beatstep pro to control my Matrix 6!
This should also work with the Matrix 6R and 1000.

## Requirements & Prereq's
It requires a arduino (uno is what I used), a midi shield and the Arduino midi library.

The Matrix 6 is running 2.14/2.15 firmware for speedy parameters.  (thank you TaunTek!!!)

Note: CC/Sysex commands don’t exist for the mod matrix :(
